# Hi, I'm Frisco ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer currently working at a fintech company in Indonesia. I mainly work with **Golang** and handle database systems like **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch**. I enjoy building reliable, efficient backend services and learning new technologies along the way.
