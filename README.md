## Back-end Developer

***TwisCode Pte Ltd**, Surabaya, Indonesia — (Sept 2020 - Present)*

As a back-end developer, I have the responsibility to develop API end-points on many projects, and also make sure that the data transferred correctly to the front-end developer. Below is some projects that i have been joined and developed for:

- **Online Margin Opening (OMO) Mandiri Sekuritas**

    This project is a part of another project with the same client, and both of them are connected. This website is used to manage opening margin account data from the selected users, also provide approval and rejection action for many roles there.

    ***Golang, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ***

- **Stellar Pass**

    In this project, I develop the dashboard system that is used to manage the business flow data. I mostly code for bug fixing and add some features like filter function, search function, and export data function.

    ***Laravel, MySQL***

- **The Lenstory**

    This website is used to serve the customers that order the photography services. Same with others, I'm not developing it from scratch. The biggest task that I've to code in this project is to add the third-party payment system (called Faspay) to the system.

    ***Laravel, MySQL, Faspay Payment System***

- **Integrated Facility Management (IFM)**

    The dashboard website that used to manage the facility data like staff, schedule, division, and more others. The Fact, this project was developed using The PHP Framework named Symfony, which is not a popular framework, and the resources about it are limited. But around the time, I can develop it very well, even though in the beginning it is very hard for me.

    ***Symfony, SQL Server***

## Web Developer Intern

In this company, I joined their IT division as a Web Developer. I have the responsibility to support their developer in developing their warehouse system. During my internship period, I always communicate with their developer in the development process. In the end, even though the application is not finished, at least I have helped him to achieve the minimum requirements that the company wants.

## Web Developer

# 🛠️ Skills

## 💻 Technology

### PHP

I was code more than 2 years of experience with this programming language, so many projects (that it is published or not) were built using this programming language. I mostly build an application using a framework like Laravel, CodeIgniter, or Symfony.

### Golang

Golang is my 2nd back-end programming language, I learned it when I got my first job as a Back-end Developer. For the first time, I learned about the basics of this programming language like variable initiation, function/method, struct, looping, decision statement, etc. Then, I tried to adapt with my first project that using this programming language by understanding the project structure and how data processed in it.

### JavaScript

Currently, I learning this programming language, it's so powerful when I want to make a full-stack application only using one programming language. Also, so many members in the tech forum suggested me to learn JavaScript instead of others.

## 🗣️ Languages

### Bahasa Indonesia 🇮🇩

I from Indonesia, so Bahasa is my native language. Specifically, I was born in Java Island, it does not mean that I speak in Java, haha. In my city, most people are speaking in Boso Jowo like "opo kabare?", "sugeng dalu", "badhe teng pundi?", etc.

### English 🇺🇸

There is so much documentation of the technology that using English as their main language (some of them are only available in English), so I must learn English to understand the documentation. Also, when I was in primary school until university, English is always being there.
